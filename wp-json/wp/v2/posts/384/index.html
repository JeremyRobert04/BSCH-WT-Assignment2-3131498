Playgrounds on every corner and a passion for the national team that saw the 4400 seats in the Mejdan hall snapped up in two short hours. And no doubt several hundred more, as most of the spectators spent the evening standing up in an arena packed to the rafters. Ultras from local club Soboda, dressed all in black, quickly raised the temperature. And calming this volcano became the Bleus&#8217; number-one objective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-25cbfb044f3b642a5854aeed86bbe857\" style=\"color:#000000\">While Aziz Bekir continued to bring the centimetres out of his bench, Vincent Collet went for the light cavalry, and after Strazel, Nadir Hifi also made his international debut. A very brief moment of breath in a tough, bitter encounter from which Guerschon Yabusele, overpowering on the rebound, and Isa\u00efa Cordinier, in a more aerial style, often emerged. But it wasn&#8217;t enough to open up any kind of gap, as neither team managed to take a lead of more than six points in the first half.<br><br>After a pretty marriage proposal at the break, France didn&#8217;t go for romance but for defensive impenetrability. Multiplying stolen balls, they finally managed to run. An authoritative 13-0 run in four minutes gave them some breathing space (47-34) and left Bosnia on the verge of a knockout as Jaylen Hoard played his first minutes.<br><br>However, former Parisian Amar Gegic kept Bosnia&#8217;s hopes alive at the quarter&#8217;s buzzer and with an interception later on. And hope is a powerful refuge in which Musa and his team-mates nestled, buoyed by a crowd once again in meltdown, forcing Vincent Collet to stop the bleeding. However, finding their way to the circle remained a challenge: not a basket scored in six minutes as the money-time approached, and free-throws abandoned along the way. But on the other side of the court, the defense didn&#8217;t give an inch to the home team and Yabusele and Poirier, in force, ended up imposing their law in the basket.<br><br>With their solidity, Les Bleus scored a second decisive victory in the race for EuroBasket 2025, when they face Cyprus, the weakest team in the group, in November.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Les Bleus came through the Bosnia-Herzegovina trap in Tuzla with a solid 74-64 victory.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":385,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[30],"tags":[36,25,27,26],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/384"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=384"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/384\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":643,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/384\/revisions\/643"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/385"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=384"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=384"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=384"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
